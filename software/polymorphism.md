# Polymorphism

## **About**

_Giving an action one name that is shared up and down an object hierarchy, with each object in the hierarchy implementing the action in a way appropriate to itself._

* Polymorphism means “something that occurs in several different forms.”
* There are two main types in OOP:
  * Static
  * Dynamic

## **Static Polymorphism**

* Static polymorphism allows you to implement multiple methods of the same name (but with different parameters) within the same class.
* This process is known as method overloading.
* The parameter sets must differ in at least one of these ways.

## **Dynamic Polymorphism**

* Within an inheritance hierarchy, a subclass can override a method of its superclass - this allows the coder of the subclass to customise or completely replace the behaviour of that method.
* This is a form of polymorphism - both methods share the same name and parameters, but they provide different functionality depending on whether they’re implemented by the superclass or the subclass.

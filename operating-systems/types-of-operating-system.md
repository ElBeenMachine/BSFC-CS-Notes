# Types of Operating System

### Multi-tasking Operating Systems

* With computers, smartphones, and tablets, we expect to have more than one application open at once:
* In single-processor systems, each active program is scheduled to receive a tiny time slice in quick rotation, giving the impression they are operating at the same time.
* Even modern processors with multiple cores still need to handle many processes at the same time.

### Multi-user Operating System

* Most operating systems you will be familiar with from school or work allow more than one person to use a computer at the same time.
* The computer will manage the user’s various permissions and access rights when they log on.
* Server operating systems software will handle the requests of multiple people using different computers on a network at the same time.

### Distributed Operating System

* You can combine the processing power of multiple computers across a network for a single task.
* In distributed computing, the operating system controls and coordinates the computers, presenting them to the user as if they were a single system.
* As a system becomes busy with more user requests, additional servers might automatically join the system, load-balancing requests without you every knowing.

### Embedded Operating Systems

* Computers are not limited to the desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, and phones we use every day.
* Processors exist in an almost limitless number of devices such as:
  * Washing machines
  * set-top boxes
  * TVs
  * Car engine management
  * Home assistants
  * Traffic lights
* Embedded operating systems tend to run on dedicated hardware so they run with maximum efficiency, using low-powered processors and very little memory.

#### Real-time Operating Systems

* In safety-critical environments such as aircraft autopilot systems, hospital monitoring machines, self-drive cars and missile systems, processes must be guaranteed to execute within a known period of time.
* Plenty of redundancy is built into these systems so they can handle sudden increases in input.
* As such, processors in real-time operating systems rarely run at capacity.

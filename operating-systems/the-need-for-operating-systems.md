# The Need for Operating Systems

## **About**

An operating system is software that manages the computer (the hardware, the software, the security of the system and the user interface).

There are seven key purposes of an operating system:

* **Managing the Processor -** Deciding which process to execute next and handling interrupts to the currently executing process.
* **Managing the Memory -** Allocating and managing the memory used and relinquished by processes using paging and segmentation. Also manages Virtual memory.
* **Managing External Devices -** Using device drivers to translate operating system’s instructions into those understood by specific models of hardware device, e.g. printer.
* **Providing a Platform for Software Utilities -** The operating system provides a framework for applications to run, allowing them to open and close files easily etc. The user can also interact with the operating system to manage files and use a range of facilities e.g. file explorer.
* **Providing Networking -** Allows communication through protocols to other machines and devices.
* **Managing Security -** Servicing and denying requests to access the resources connected to the computer e.g. Shared Drives.
* **Providing a User Interface** - Users interact with applications through the interface provided by the operating system. This may be graphical, such as Graphical User Interfaces (WIMP - Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers), menu driven or command line interface.

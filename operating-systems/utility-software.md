# Utility Software

### About

Tend to be small programs which have one specific purpose.

Purpose is normally concerned with the maintenance and well running of a computer system.

### **Antivirus**

* Any programs which help to detect and remove any malicious programs which are designed to harm a system in some form or another.

### **Disk-Defragmentation Software**

* Over time, a hard disk will become fragmented. This occurs as new files are added, and old ones deleted.
* Free space often becomes scattered across the disk and a program or files must be split up into multiple small chunks and spread across the disk to make it fit.
* The more fragmented the disk becomes, the slower the computer will perform.
* Defragmentation utilities attempt to consolidate the split files and free space, so reading and writing to the disk becomes more efficient.

### **Compression**

* Any programs that attempt to reduce the amount of physical space that files take up when they are stored.

### **File Manager**

* Programs that allow users to easily copy, move, rename, delete, or modify files and directories on a computer system.

### **Firewalls**

* These are any programs that help to prevent unauthorised access to a computer system or network.
* Schools or other large organisations will often install firewalls on their networks to both prevent intrusion on their network, but to also prevent employee’s internally accessing content outside but to also prevent employee’s internally accessing content outside of the network during work hours that they deem inappropriate.

### **Backup Software**

* Any programs that allow for manual or automatic backing up of files.
* This could be to another disk, to a removable device, to a network file server or to a cloud-based storage system.

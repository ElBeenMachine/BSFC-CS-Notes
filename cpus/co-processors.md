# Co-Processors

### About

A co-processor is any additional processor used for a specialised task.

The purpose is to improve overall performance of the computer system by executing concurrently with the main CPU but with a highly bespoke set of electronics.

### **Graphical Processing Unit**

* A co-processor.
* Originally used for rendering graphics.
* Due to the high number of cores, they are not just used for rendering graphics.
* Each core works slower than a CPU core and has fewer features.
* Slower than CPUs, but highly specialised.

### **What They’re Best At:**

* **CPUs**
  * Complex operations, on small data sets.
* **GPUs**
  * Simple manipulations but to much larger data sets.
  * Better at any operation where a larger data set is used.

# C.I.S.C and R.I.S.C Processors

## **Instruction Sets**

* At the core of all computers are their instruction sets.
* This is the complete set of all instructions written in machine code that are recognisable and thus executable by the CPUs.
* Different CPU designs will have a different core instruction set.
* These belong to two main categories, RISC and CISC.

## **Complex Instruction Set Computing (C.I.S.C)**

* Machine manufacturers offer larger and more complex sets of machine instructions available on their CPUs.
* The manufacturer needs to add more complex circuitry. Therefore, more complex hardware is needed but it can support simpler coding.
* Each instruction requires multiple machine cycles.
* Most desktops and laptops use a CISC architecture.
* Produced by intel and AMD.

## **Reduced Instruction Set Computing (R.I.S.C)**

* Hardware is often simple, but software needs to be more complicated.
* Each instruction can be carried out in a single machine cycle.
* Pipelining can be used to speed up processing. It can only be used on RISC processors as each instruction only takes one machine cycle.
* Most smartphones and tablets use RISC CPUs (based on arm).
* Cheaper (less silicone required).
* Lower clock speed but performs simpler tasks better than CISC CPUs.
* Lower energy requirements.

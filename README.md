# BSFC A Level Computer Science Notes

## What Is This?

This website is a collation of notes from the A-Level computer science course at Birkenhead Sixth Form College.

The site will be hosted using GitBook until the final project is complete. (Currently in development by Ollie Beenham at https://github.com/ElBeenMachine/BSFC-Notes). If you would like to help in the development of the project, please message me on Discord or Teams.&#x20;
